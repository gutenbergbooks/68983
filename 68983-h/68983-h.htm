<p>I started serving College Students lunches and waffle suppers in a
small way in my parlor and selling homemade candy. My business became
very popular with the College Students and I was obliged to extend my
facilities.</p>

<p>So I had three rooms arched and made in one large room and decorated
very prettily. The room seated 104 students very comfortably and was
very popular among the students and their friends as it was one of the
most attractive Tea Rooms established for College Women.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FISH">FISH</h2>
</div>


<h3>Broiled Shad.</h3>

<p>Have it split down the back and lay it on a large meat platter and
season with pepper and salt for an hour before cooking. Then rub
the bars of a double gridiron with lard or beef suet to prevent
sticking. Lay the fish on and broil slowly doing the inside first.
Turn frequently. It will take from eight to fifteen minutes according
to size of fish. When the bone may be easily lifted from the fish, the
cooking is completed. Remove at once to a hot platter, pour over it an
ounce of melted butter with a teaspoonful of minced parsley and serve
hot.</p>

<p>Roes of the shad seasoned, roll in flour on both sides and put them in
a fry pan of grease and fry light brown on both sides.</p>

highly with butter, salt, pepper and chopped parsley, sew the fish up,

crumbs or corn meal. Drop in deep hot fat and fry.</p>


<h3>Lobsters (To select and Open.)</h3>

<p>Buy those that have been boiled but a few hours. The heaviest whether
large or small are best. In opening them care must be taken to remove
the poisonous part. This lies in the head, all of which must be thrown
away, as well as the vein which passes from it through the body. All
the other parts are good. Break the shell with hammer and cut open
the body on the under side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> with a sharp knife. Carefully examine the
tormelly or green part to see that there is none of the poison vein in
it. If you are going to make salad put it on a platter, the meat from
the body in the centre and that of the large claws at each end of the
dish, arrange some of the small claws around the edge. Garnish with
lettuce and serve with a boiled dressing.</p>


<h3>Deviled Lobsters.</h3>

equal amount of bread crumbs mixed in milk, a very little red pepper,
salt, a good deal of butter and if liked a little mustard ready mixed
is added, after washing the shells replace the mixture and bake in a
quick oven. This mixture can be made into balls, dipped into beaten egg
and rolled in cracker and makes delicious croquettes if fried.</p>

well, heat gradually until the scum rises, skim very clean. Then add
cup of hot milk thicken with 1 tablespoon flour and 1 tablespoonful of
butter, a little pepper and salt, serve hot.</p>

two rings for one bottom crust, for the filling; Take one quart of new
milk, ¹⁄₂ cup of butter, salt, pepper and liquid from one quart of
oyster, set this in pan of water to cook. When scalding hot (do not

shells and serve hot.</p>

contents are heated again hot enough to serve.</p>

powdered sage into the rind where it is cut and rub it over with pepper
and salt and place it in a hot oven. 8 <abbr title="pounds">lbs</abbr>. will require about 3 <abbr title="hours">hrs</abbr>.

the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="POULTRY_AND_GAME">POULTRY AND GAME</h2>
</div>


<p>CAUTION:—To roast fowls the fire must be quick and clear. Baste
frequently and if you don’t use a double roaster, keep white paper
pinned on the breast till it is nearly done.</p>

<p>Take the turkey, draw it and wash it clean and dry with a clean towel.
Turkey Dressing. Take 1 loaf of stale bread, free of crust cut into
inch cubes and pour over it 1 pint of hot milk, stir it all soft and
smooth, then beat an egg light and add to the mixture, season with
pepper and salt and poultry seasoning, 1 table spoon of melted butter.
Then stuff your turkey with this mixture. Then sew it up and draw legs
back close to the body and the wings back against the side so that the
breast will stand out prominently. Dust the turkey with salt and pepper
and drawn butter, then lay on a grate in the roast pan with down. This
permits the juice to run down into the breast and makes it tender and
juicy. The oven should be very hot when the turkey is first put in
and the heat slightly reduced after the first ¹⁄₂ hour. Cook in the
original position for the first hour then turn it over on its back and
cook until a light brown, allowing for cooking 15 minutes to a <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr></p>


<h3>Roast Duck.</h3>

<p>After drawing the duck, wiping out with a clean towel, do not wash
them, cut off wings to the second joint. Roast in a very hot oven from
15 to 20 minutes in a baking pan containing a little water, any one of
the dressings may be chosen for the filling but I use just the plain
dressing and always serve apple sauce with duck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>


<h3>Chestnut Dressing.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pint of chestnut, prepare the nut by making a cut in each with
a sharp knife. Then put them in a kettle, cover with cold water, bring
to a boil and boil exactly 2 minutes. Remove from the water, drain,
turn in a pan with a little butter and shake over fire, after this the
shells and skins may be removed together. Chop the nuts, add a large
cupful of grated bread crumb, 4 tablespoonful of butter, melted, 1
tablespoonful of shredded parsley, ¹⁄₂ teaspoonful of ground poultry
seasoning salt and pepper to taste. This gives rather a dry dressing
and sufficient hot water to mix to a paste may be added if a moist
dressing is preferred.</p>


<h3>Oyster Dressing.</h3>

<p>1 quart of oysters will be required for an ordinary sized turkey. Grate
into a mixing bowl 4 large cupfuls of bread crumbs, add a teaspoonful
of chopped celery, drain the oysters either chop or leave them whole, 1
salt spoonful of white pepper, 1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and
1 tablespoon of melted butter, and add the cup of oyster liquid. ¹⁄₂
cup of sherry may be added.</p>


<h3>Fricassee Chicken.</h3>

<p>Singe, draw the chicken and disjoint it, put a ¹⁄₄ <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of bacon in a
sauce pan and let the fat fry out slowly. When the bacon is crisp lift
it out and put it aside. Flour the pieces of chicken, drop them in the
hot bacon fat, shake and turn them until brown then draw them to one
side of the saucepan. Add to the fat 3 level tablespoonfuls of flour,
mix and add 1 pint of boiling water, stir until boiling, add a level
teaspoonful of salt, cover and simmer gently until the chicken is done
(1 <abbr title="hour">hr</abbr>.). Remove from the pan and place on a good size platter with
the gravy poured over it and split biscuit laid around the outside of
platter.</p>


<h3>Broiled Guenia.</h3>

<p>Guenia is split open on the back and placed on a broiler over a hot
fire and cooked to a light brown on both sides. Remove the guenia
season with salt and pepper and tablespoon of hot butter poured over
then place in oven for about 10 minutes before serving and serve hot.</p>


<h3>Roast Goose.</h3>

<p>Select a young goose weighing 8 or 10 <abbr title="pounds">lbs</abbr>., wash and scrub the skin
thoroughly and cleanse with warm water. Wipe the fowl dry and stuff
with any of the preceding dressings. Sew the goose and steam for ¹⁄₂
hour to draw out the oil. Then place in a pan, dredge with salt, pepper
and a little flour, rub over the outside, pouring in a little hot water
into the pan and put the goose in a hot oven to roast when it begins to
brown baste often. Cook for 1 hour and ¹⁄₂ until brown and tender.</p>


<h3>Creamed Chicken.</h3>

<p>Prepare it the same as for fricassee chicken, put in a kettle, cover it
with water and let it cook till tender, before removing from the kettle
season with salt and pepper, then remove from the kettle when cool,
remove it from the bones and thicken the gravy with 2 tablespoonsful of
flour in a little cold water to dissolve the flour, then add 1 cup of
milk and cream and serve with hot waffles.</p>


<h3>Waffles With Creamed Chicken.</h3>

<p>3 eggs beaten separate, then add 1 <abbr title="pint">pt.</abbr> of milk, 1 large tablespoonful
of melted butter, 1 even teaspoonful of salt and flour enough
to thicken the same as for pan cakes. Stir all together with 2
tablespoonsful of Baking Powder and the whites of the eggs beaten stiff
the last thing. Have waffle iron hot and bake until a light brown. This

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BREAD">BREAD</h2>
</div>


<p>Three things must be exactly right in order to have good bread, the
quality of the yeast, the lightness or fermentation of the dough and
the heat of the oven. It requires careful attention and good judgement
to decide when all are right, no precise rules can be given.</p>


<h3>Good Bread (White)</h3>

<p>Scald 1 <abbr title="quart">qt</abbr> of milk when cool add 1 Fleischmann yeast cake dissolved in
luke warm water. 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of lard or
butter melted, 1 tablespoon of salt, stir in 6 <abbr title="quarts">qts</abbr> of sifted flour or
more, enough to make a stiff dough, then put in a bread pan or deep
bowl to rise over night. In the morning knead and put in pans. Let rise
to the top of the pan. Put in hot oven, bake 45 minutes.</p>


<h3>Grandmother’s Old Fashioned Yeast.</h3>

<p>Wash pare and boil 6 large potatoes until soft. If the water boils away
very much, add enough more to make about 3 pints. After removing the
potatoes from the kettle, add to the water in which they were boiled a
very small pinch of hops. The water should be but slightly colored. Let
the water boil hard for 10 minutes, now take a large pitcher or earthen
crock which will hold 2 to 3 quarts. Put the potatoes in the pitcher
and mash them smooth. Then add ¹⁄₂ cup of flour, the same of sugar and
a tablespoon of salt, being sure to rub out all the lumps. Place a fine
strainer in the top of pitcher and as the hop water boils, add 1 or 2
cups of water and stir again until all is smooth. Then add the rest of
the water. There should be about 2 quarts of yeast. When just warm add
¹⁄₂ cake of magic yeast. 1 cup will raise a sponge for 5 or 6 loaves.
This yeast should be as thick as thin cream and about the color. This
yeast will rise very quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> and when it begins to foam, stir 2 or 3
times. Do not bottle yeast but keep in the pitcher and place a saucer
over the top. Keep in a cool place in winter and in the refrigerator in
summer. It will keep sweet for two or three weeks.</p>


<h3>Whole Wheat Bread.</h3>

<p>Take 1 Fleischmann yeast cake, dissolved in 1¹⁄₂ cups of lukewarm water.

tablespoon of melted lard, 2 heaping teaspoons of baking powder, 2 cups
and ¹⁄₂ of milk or part water can be used. The wetting depends on the
flour. It should be mixed quite soft. Bake in moderate oven in covered
pan 1 hour.</p>

put the milk and water over the fire to boil, reserve enough to wet
the rice. Stir out the lumps add a large teaspoon of salt and when the
milk and water boil, stir in the rice, exactly as when you make gruel.
Boil it up two or three minutes, stirring it repeatedly, then pour it
out into your bread pan and immediately stir in as much flour as you
can with a spoon. After it is cool enough and of this be very sure, as
scalding the yeast will make heavy, sour bread, full of holes, add a
gill of yeast and let it stand until morning. Then knead in more flour
until the dough ceases to stick to the hands. It is necessary to make
this kind of bread a little stiffer than that in which no rice is used,
else there will be a heavy streak through the loaf. It is an elegant
bread, keeps moist several days and is particularly good toasted.</p>


<h3>English Muffins.</h3>

<p>3 eggs beaten light, 2 cups of milk, 1 large tablespoon of melted
butter, 1 teaspoon of salt, ¹⁄₂ compressed yeast cake dissolved in

portion, rest in this salted water 2 or 3 hours or until the water
turns dark. After soaking put the vegetable into fresh cold water and
let it come to the boiling stage. Boil until tender, salting the water
slightly. It will take about ¹⁄₂ hour. It is well to cook the scooped
out pulp longer then the shells, so as to have it very soft. The shells
should be tender but not so tender that they will lose their shape. Set
the shell aside on an earthen plate. It is well not to let them come
into contact with tin. Now mash the pieces of scooped out egg plant
to a pulp with a wooden potato masher and to every cupful add 2 or 3
cupfuls of soft bread crumbs. Mix the two together and if they seem
too stiff add a little milk. Season with a tiny minced onion, a scant

stew pan with slice or two of bacon fried crisp. Take out the bacon and
lay in the steak, turn it on all sides until it is done. Then put in 2
cups of water or meat stock with 1 teaspoonful salt and pepper, cover

to look inviting and tempting. The method of draining or drying is a
very easy performance so long as the salad leaves whatever they may be

leaves which should be broken, not cut with knife into a wire basket
and drying them well until the outer moisture of the leaves is well
absorbed. The salad then is ready for mixing.</p>

</div>


<p class="center">CAUTION</p>

<p>Paste for pies should be quite thin and rolled a little larger than the
tin to allow for shrinkage. Allow more paste for the upper than the
under crust and be sure to perforate the former. Always brush the under
crust with cold water and press the upper one down on it. When baking
juicy fruit pies make an incision in the crust and place a small funnel
shaped piece of paper into the incision. This will keep the juice from
escaping at the sides of the pie. Never grease pie tins. Properly made
pastry will grease its own tins. For baking pastry requires from 30 to
45 minutes.</p>

a mixing board and roll out lightly for your pies. Always make a few

<p>Hints for making cakes. The flour should always be very dry and well
sifted. White sugar is purer and sweeter for cakes and pastries than
the brown sugar. If the butter is very hard soften but do not melt it
when soda is used dissolve it before adding to the ground mixture.
Fruit should be thoroughly dry if added to the other ingredients damp,
cakes will be liable to be heavy. Dust your fruit with a little of the
flour to be used for the cake and stir into the other ingredients just
before putting in the rest of the flour. The ingredients should be well
beaten before mixing in the flour except in a few plain cakes that are
beaten all together. All cakes bake nicer if the pan used is lined with
buttered paper.</p>
